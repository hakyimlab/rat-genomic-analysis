'''
Script to split a GTEx genotype file into multiple files by chromosome.

From commandline, first argument is the genotype file, second is the
prefix for the output files.  The suffix 'chrN.txt' will be added to the
prefix provided, where N is the chromosome number.

In splitting, script will only keep unambiguously stranded SNPs. I.e.,
no INDELs and no SNPs with polymorphisms A->T and vice-versa, or C->G
and vice-versa.

The input file is expected to be a tab-delimited text file including a
header row, where the header field is ID (for snp varID) and then a
variable number of fields with the sample ID numbers.  The first column
has the snp ID in the format of (chr_pos_refAll_effAll_build) and the
dosages are encoded on a 0-2 scale representing the number or imputed
number of the effect alleles the sample posseses.
